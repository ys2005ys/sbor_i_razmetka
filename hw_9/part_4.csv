review
"after installation , which was very simple .... i downloaded any updated software from the creative website , before i downloaded any music ."
no one has ever come to my house and noticed ' diaper odor . '
it is hot enough to be annoying .
the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad . 
this program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another .
the touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon 't slip which was very thoughtful .
i 've since gotten the linksys modem ( befcmu10 ) and stacked it with the wrt54g router and it works fantastic ! ! !
you 'll love it !
the total price with delivery ( free shipping ) was $ 135 !
there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours ! 
"3- it is slow , if you keep the original configuration and progs ( why 'd u buy it then ? ! ) it 'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen nokias ."
the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot . 
- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price 
"this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) . "
this dvd play is basicly junk . 
one of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to windows media player .
the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics . 
"so i e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question , and got a reply which was totally unresponsive ( it looked as though they didn 't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs ) ."
"all-in-all , creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features , and i look forward to the nomad / zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype ."
"it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies . "
"m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray ! "
"unfortunately , linksys does not write the best documentation ."
all in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment .
i enjoy getting use to the touch pad .
"the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable . "
replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 . 
even viewed cds full of jpgs . 
it 's a rip off if one buys norton internet security and antivirus .
the vibration is not top . 
"but since it 's so small , it isn 't a big deal to bring it with me ."
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots . 
"apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands . "
"after attempting to navigate the clumsy touch-pad system , i could not get the unit to download my wma files ."
yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy . 
"i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever . "
"you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck "
"i downloaded and updated the firmware , and followed the easy setup instructions ."
) -can 't be left in the car ... it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long .
"big lcd screen - at least for me , 2 "" is enough"
"i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results . "
"i have used norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years , the software has gotten more and more disgraceful ."
"even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little , resulting in a noisy start-up ."
this thing seriously is a good player though . 
crappy headphones . 
not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording 
"the zen micro fm receiver is ok , not great ."
there technical service isn 't helpful either ; they just read what 's on their website and charge you $ 50 ( + toll fees ) to do it .
it also lets you remove songs from the play order . 
all in all it hasn 't been a bad product .
"playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists . "
"overall : i highly dislike the ipod , even though the sound quality and design is above-average ."
"for the money , i 'm not sure you can do better ."
"i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me . "
"all in all , this is a wonderful device ."
in a week of use i 've never had to reboot the router .
this was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit .
"the sound is incredible ; very clean , very wide dynamic range of bass , mids and highs , and can be very loud if i turn it up full blast ."
"second , it is incredibly easy to use ."
- some features in the user interface 
after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem .
it is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it .
"these tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions , and i found the menu to be much more navigable ."
"i have transferred in about 2,400 tracks so far - very easy to use both the ipod and itunes ."
"it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman . "
overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned . 
what an upgrade ! ! !
"two : it has a removeable / rechargeable battery , so you don 't have to send the thing in when the re !"
4 ) one nice thing about nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices .
all the good reviews for the sd500 are true .
"the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) . "
"also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 "" tv ). "
"in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images . "
this router works at 54mbps that 's megabyte not kilobyte .
"i , as many others , have waited for many years for the convergence of price , features , size and ease of use to hit that happy center point ."
my first impression was positive . 
"3 ) joy stick for eazy navigation , 35mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff ."
"i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing . "
"that 's when it went from oderless , to oderous !"
i love the storage in this thing . 
the price compared to the ipod is great . 
there is no way you can talk with customer care about this .
this camera is bulletproof .
it seems like the software is just not responding .
the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be . 
"but with a low price , comes lower quality . "
"sure they say if it 's their fault you won 't get charged , but they are the ones who get to decide whether it 's their fault ."
the color and light i captured with this camera on a 12-day trip to turkey ( gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques ) were far superior to anything i 've ever gotten with a traditional 35-mm film camera .
the panorama setting is unbelieveable !
1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable . 
wow - was that disappointing and we didn 't even have it 6 months before it broke .
"now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it ! "
i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down . 
"there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization . "
"i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it . "
the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough . 
such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in ... wrong !
"i finally got a free support number for norton through my isp support staff , but waited an hour or more for a voice ."
"speaker phone quality is good , and poping in a 512mb mmc card , it rocks !"
"the "" movies "" last about 5 seconds ."
overall i like it . 
i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode . 
"even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out . "
